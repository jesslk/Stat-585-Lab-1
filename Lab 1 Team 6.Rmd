### Building a Book 

1. Write a paragraph on the biggest problem you encountered when you were building the book, and how you managed to solve it.

We installed all the packakges we need to knit the file to html, but we keep getting the same error message in line 783 of Conditions.Rmd, "Error: 'error' inherits from 'warning/condition' not 'error_bad_argument".  






```{r}
library(tidyverse)
station <- read_fwf("ushcn-v2.5-stations.txt", fwf_cols("COUNTRY CODE" == c(1,2), "NETWORK CODE" == c(3), "ID PLACEHOLDERS" == c(4,5), "COOP ID" == c(6:11), "LATITUDE" == c(13:20), "LONGITUDE" == c(22:30), "ELEVATION" == c(33:37), "STATE" == c(39,40), "NAME" == c(42:71)) )

?read_fwf
```
